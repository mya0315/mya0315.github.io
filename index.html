<p>Many people are frustrated about going to a restaurant or fast food place and the line or wait time is very long. They feel like they spent time going to the restaurant/ fast food place, then they find out they have to wait even longer because of lines and wait times. Our solution should provide people an advantage of looking at restaurant wait times or see how crowded it is before they spend the time driving to these resturants.</p>
